- supporting vulnerable children, families and Communities in the Philippines. 
Our vision is to relieve the suffering and hardships vulnerable children and families face everyday by providing care and support where it’s needed most. 
We are committed to reducing poverty and building a positive future for the children and adults we work with. Our work revolves around two core development areas: livelihood and educational programmes.
Doing little can make a big difference
We believe in the proverb, ’Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.’ We think of sustainability. If we only prepare food for them, it is very exhausting and draining to our energy and resources. But on this initiative we can generate income for them and for other programmes.
